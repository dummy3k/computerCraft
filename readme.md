gh (github helper)
==================

Download this:
```
> pastebin get xxC3swG6 gh
```

Now you can download all current versions of my lua scripts like so:
```
> gh fox
```

This will download ```fox.lua``` from my repository and save it as
```fox``` on the ComputerCraft turtle.

If you want to clone my github repository, you will need to edit ```gh.lua``` and replace my user name with yours. Then you should update the pastebin url in this document.
